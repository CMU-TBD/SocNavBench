# SocNavBench
Welcome to the Social Navigation Benchmark utility (SocNavBench), a codebase for benchmarking robot planning algorithms against various episodes of containing multi-agent environments, accompanying out paper ["SocNavBench: A Grounded Simulation Testing Framework for Evaluating Social Navigation"](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~abhijatb/assets/THRI_SocNav_Benchmark.pdf).

We provide scenarios curated from real world data for social navigation algorithms to be tested and evaluated on.

We also provide multiple curated maps that closely resemble the environments for the pedestrian datasets.

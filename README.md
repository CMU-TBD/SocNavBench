# SocNavBench
Welcome to the Social Navigation Benchmark utility (SocNavBench), a codebase for benchmarking robot planning algorithms against various episodes of containing multi-agent environments, accompanying out paper ["SocNavBench: A Grounded Simulation Testing Framework for Evaluating Social Navigation"](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~abhijatb/assets/THRI_SocNav_Benchmark.pdf).

We provide scenarios curated from real world data for social navigation algorithms to be tested and evaluated on.
